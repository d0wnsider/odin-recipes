        <h1>Beef Pares</h1>

            The word "pares" means "pair" or "pairing" in English. 
            This term was coined because the beef stew is always served with rice and soup as part of an all-in-one, 
            low-cost meal set sold in local roadside eateries. Beef Pares is a popular dish for motorists looking for a hot, 
            filling meal after a long day on the road. This dish is also available at carinderias or "pares houses" near local establishments such as schools, hospitals, and factories. 
            It is so well-loved and popular that even some high-end restaurants have included this dish on their menus.

        <p>
            While this dish commonly uses beef brisket, you may technically use any part you prefer. 
            Other cuts of beef that can be used, such as chuck, round, and bone-in short ribs may take slightly longer to tenderize, 
            but you can always use your pressure cooker for these!

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>2 pounds beef. Place the beef in a large bowl. 
                Add tap water and soak for at 10-15 minutes to draw out the blood to have a clearer broth. 
                Discard the water and quickly rinse the beef.</li>
            <li>8-10 cups water,1 medium yellow onion,1 tablespoon peppercorn,2 tablespoons fish sauce
                Bring 8-10 cups of water to a boil over high heat. Add the beef, onion, peppercorn and fish sauce. 
                Cover with the lid and turn heat to low. Let it cook until the meat is just fork-tender, about 30-40 minutes. 
                You might need to add water if it gets too low, you will need the broth later.</li>
            <li>Take the meat out from the broth. Cut it into smaller cubes, about 1x1-inch. Set aside. 
                If using beef shank, return the bones to the pot of broth. 
                You may add some more water if needed and let it boil for a few more minutes.</li>
            <li>Salt,2 tablespoons toasted garlic,½ cup spring onions
                Season the broth with salt if needed and add some roasted garlic and chopped spring onion. 
                This soup will be served later.</li>
            <li>1 medium onion,1 thumb ginger,4 cloves garlic,2 tablespoons oil
                In a separate pot or deep pan, heat oil over medium heat. Then saute onion, garlic and ginger until tender.</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce,3-4 pieces star anise,¼ teaspoon five-spice,3 pieces bay leaves,2-3 tablespoons brown sugar,¼ teaspoon ground pepper
                Add the beef and cook until the edges turn slightly brown. Pour in the soy sauce, star anise, five-spice, 
                bay leaves, brown sugar, ground pepper and stir.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch
                Add 2 cups of the beef broth and the cornstarch slurry. 
                Cover with the lid and bring to a simmer. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until the meat is very tender.</li>
            <li>Divide into serving bowls, top with some roasted garlic and chopped green onions. 
                Serve with fried garlic rice and bowl of the soup.</li>
